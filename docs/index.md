## Week 1 Journal

This week we :

1. Overviewed the course outline and project requirements. 
2. Learned about web frameworks (collection of HTML, CSS and Javascript files that speed up site development by providing a foundation for structure, layout and functionality for web app).
3. Learned about information architecture (Organising information to fit project needs and provide flexibility.)

Pros of using web frameworks:
- Speeds up development time
- Cross browser compatiability
- Building on what's already done. 

Cons:
- We don't need most of the code the framework offers.
- Size of project will become big.
- Modifying the framework to fit the project needs can be time-consuming. 
- Need to pay close attention to formal documentation to make changes.

We also practised creating a MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular & Node) stack application using this guide: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/mongodb-for-mean-stack-developers/install-mongodb
